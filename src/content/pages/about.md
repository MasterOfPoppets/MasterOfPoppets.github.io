Quantum Web Development Ltd was set up by Gareth Hughes in 2015.

Gareth graduated from the University of Reading in 2006 with a MEng in Computer Science. Leaving university he took a job programing in Java which he stuck at for 8 years before finally seeing the light and realising that this new fangled Javascript stuff was far more exciting!

This realisation led him to setting up Quantum Web Development Ltd and enter the exciting world of a contract full-stack Javascript developer.

Some of the more interesting things in the land of Javascript are:

1.  Node.js streams
2.  (Functional) Reactive Programing
3.  Node modules within the browser with Browserify
4.  ES6 Transpiling with Babel
