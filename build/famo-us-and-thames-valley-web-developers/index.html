<p>Several months ago I went along to my first meetup - the rather fantastic <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Thames-Valley-Web-Developers/">Thames Valley Web Developers</a>. My first meetup was a brief introduction to AngularJS and a more in depth talk about how to test Angular apps from one of their own - <a href="https://github.com/petebacondarwin">Pete Bacon Darwin</a>. This was great because at the time I had only been looking at Angular for a few months myself and the talk just helped everything to &#39;click&#39; in my mind - a real lightbulb moment!</p>
<p>Fast forward to this week and the upcoming schedule for the first few months of next year and the talks being given. There is an interesting looking talk from the people at <a href="https://www.backand.com/">Back&amp;</a> but what is really exciting is a talk from the guys at <a href="http://famo.us/">Famo.us</a>!</p>
<p>Famo.us is an open source Javascript framework for creating smooth and complex UIs across any type of screen. Better still, they are also working closely with the guys at Angular, making fantastic use of directives in order to intuitively create the Famo.us modifiers and surfaces within HTML and leaving the Javascript, within Angular, to take care of the computational stuff, like animation!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent all week playing with it and I hope to be able to incorporate it onto this site in the near future, once I have a few other things sorted out!</p>
<p>In the mean time, if you are in the Reading or Oxford areas and would like to hear more about Famo.us, then come along to the meetup on 2nd Febuary! <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Thames-Valley-Web-Developers/events/218981950/">More details here...</a></p>
