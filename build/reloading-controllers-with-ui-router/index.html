</header><p>When I began developing this site, I made the decision to use <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router">UI Router</a> for the client side routing, as opposed to ngRoute which is built-in to Angular.</p>
<p>I made this decision because, despite the fact it is newer and therefore has issues, the benefits outweigh this. For example, I new that I wanted to create nested views as part of my portfolio page, and ngRoute just doesn&#39;t accomodate this.</p>
<p>I also really prefer the idea of a &#39;state&#39; within my app - this feels like it fits in a lot better with the MVC architecture, and I can map different states, often within the same page, to different controllers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, whilst developing my contact page, I came across one of the issues with UI Router, namely that it isn&#39;t possible to reload a controller. This was a problem for me because I wanted the animations that I had built into the page to run every time a user transitions from submitting the form to the success page. There are various workarounds on the UI Router github page for this issue, but these didn&#39;t appear to work for me, possibly because of the nested nature of the states in my app.</p>
<p>In the end, I decided to take a look at the events that UI Router fires, and try to figure out how I could use them to my advantage. UI Router fires several events, including one that indicates a successful transition to a new state. Great! This is just what I need.</p>
<pre><code>$scope.$on(&#39;$stateChangeSuccess&#39;, function () {
  if ($state.is(&#39;contact.success&#39;)) {
    $scope.entryOpacity = $famousAnimations.animateIn();
  }
});
</code></pre><p>When I first create my controller for handling the transition to the success page, I am registering a listener to the <code>$stateChangeSuccess</code> event. From that point, every time I receive an event of that type, I check that the current state is <code>contact.success</code> and if it is, execute my animation code. I have to check the current state, since every successful transition will fire this event, regardless which state it ends up in.</p>
<p>I am fully expecting to encounter similar issues to this later on, when I introduce other animations to the app, and I am hoping that this approach to solving them is a good generic one.</p>
<p>In other news, I have now also joined the Oxford Google Developer Group - another Meetup akin to Thames Valley Web Developers. There appears to be a considerable amount of overlap between the two at the moment, since they are both organised by the same person. However, with the first meeting this evening, I am hoping to get a bit more clarification about the aims of both groups, and if necessary, focus my attention on one of the groups.</p>
