The Performance Window Group (PWG) make timber windows and doors for both private customers and trade dealers.

Their long-term vision was to rebrand their existing quoting tool, "Aperture", whilst fulfilling a number of 
requirements along the way, including:

*   Improve the ability to make timely changes to the system
*   Better embed dealers blah blah blah

They have a legacy system written in Perl and hacked together by Perl "developers".
