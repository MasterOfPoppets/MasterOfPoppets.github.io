Gareth graduated from the University of Reading in 2006 with a MEng in Computer Science. Leaving university he took a 
job programing in Java which he stuck at for 8 years before finally seeing the light and realising that this new fangled
Javascript stuff was far more exciting!

This realisation led him to setting up Quantum Web Development Ltd and enter the exciting world of a contract full-stack
Javascript developer.
