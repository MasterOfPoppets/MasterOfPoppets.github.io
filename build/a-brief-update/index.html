<body>
 <p>It has now been four months since my last post on here, but there has been an awful lot happening in that time!</p>
<p>I feel that now is probably a good time to give a short update on what&#39;s been happening and new things that I have on the horizon.</p>
<h1 id="new-job-">New job!</h1>
<p>Around Christmas I started in earnest applying for jobs using the new skills, such as AngularJS and Node.js, that I&#39;d learnt over the previous months.</p>
<p>After initially casting my new far too wide, I honed in on what I wanted from a new job - namely to work for a small and forward thinking company, either in a permanent or, preferably, contract capacity using these technologies.</p>
<p>After interviewing for a couple of small web development agencies I eventually wound up interviewing for <a href="http://www.thepwgroup.co.uk/">PWG</a> - probably not the kind of company you&#39;d initially associate with new tech. However, they were looking for someone with AngularJS and general front-end experience and were prepared to take a chance on me!</p>
<p>So far I&#39;ve been there around three months and I&#39;ve learnt a lot as I&#39;m working with another, more experienced, front-end developer. More on this soon!</p>
<h1 id="i-m-a-director-">I&#39;m a Director!</h1>
<p>With the job at PWG being a contract position, I ended up forming my own limited company after speaking to some friends about the best way to go about contracting!</p>
<p>Whilst I was looking for work, given the lack of commercial AngularJS experience I had, I was told most likely I would end up with a permanent role - so the contract came as somewhat of a surprise!</p>
<p>One of the worst aspects about setting up a new company is coming up with a kick ass name for it! Having decided that Gareth Hughes Ltd, or variations on that, was pretty lame, Jen actually came up with the name of the company that I&#39;m now the director of - Quantum Web Development Ltd.</p>
<p>Kick. Ass.</p>
<p>The one problem now though, is that I have a website (you&#39;re currently reading it) but it&#39;s not really a company website. Over the next few months, I&#39;m hoping to update the site (and the domain name) to better reflect Quantum Web Development.</p>
<p>I&#39;m thinking green.</p>
<p>I also want a kick ass logo - something that I may decide to speak to one of Jen&#39;s former colleagues about. Mates rates and all that.</p>
<h1 id="fireblogger">Fireblogger</h1>
<p>On top of all that, I&#39;ve finally been able to roll out the first iteration of my more interactive Fireblogger app, allowing me to write this post and submit it to Firebase entirely through my site, as opposed to the archaic text editing that I was previously using.</p>
<p>I must stress though, at the moment it is only the first iteration and there is a lot more to add, including</p>
<ul>
<li>Security. Of any kind.</li>
<li>Editing old posts.</li>
<li>Comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>But for now though, I&#39;m pleased to have a lot easier method to get these posts up and hopefully this should encourage me to write more frequently again - I&#39;ve certainly got a lot that I want to document!</p>
