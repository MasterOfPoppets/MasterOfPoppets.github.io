</header><p>As I mentioned a little while ago in <a href="http://garethhughes.io/blog/markdown-blogging-with-node">this</a> post, my intention was to move to an entirely client-side blogging engine. This would taking my existing solution which used Node to serve Jade templates containing a blog entry retrieved from Firebase, and moving the Firebase retrieval to the client-side.</p>
<p>The plan was to still serve a small Jade template from Node, but instead of containing the actual blog entry, it would just contain a handful of Angular directives and data-bindings that I would create with a new module.</p>
<h3 id="the-fireblogger-module">The Fireblogger module</h3>
<p>Creating a new module in Angular is great in order to encapsulate a small amount of functionality for a particular purpose. In this case, I wanted my module to do a handful of jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load all of the posts</li>
<li>Load a specific post for a given URL</li>
<li>Provide a markdown directive to display markdown</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I would be using a centralised model to hold on to this data, I needed to get my head around the way that Angular&#39;s data-binding works with regards to being updated. Whilst something as simple as</p>
<pre><code>var post = null
</code></pre><p>will allow you to assign a value to it, displaying it in the browser with an Angular data-binding such as</p>
<pre><code>{{ post }}
</code></pre><p>it is not particularly good at keeping the value updated if you changed it via code - something that will happen if a use wishes to view a different blog post. There are many solutions around to solve this problem, inlcuding setting up a \$watch, and forcing an update with \$apply, but reading into this seems to indicate that this is not the correct &quot;Angular&quot; way of doing things, and can break the digest cycle.</p>
<p>Instead, we can store the information in a <code>model</code> object. This leads to something looking a little like this</p>
<pre><code>var model = {
  post = null
}
</code></pre><p>and a data-binding such as</p>
<pre><code>{{ model.post }}
</code></pre><p>Now the factory can update the model and Angular will ensure that the data-bindings reflect this. On the surface, this is a simple change, and it definitely fits more nicely with the  MVC approach, but due to a lack of good examples online and other misleading suggestions, it took a while to figure out this was the correct way of doing things!</p>
<h3 id="improvements">Improvements</h3>
<p>Whilst the new Fireblogger module I&#39;ve created currently serves its purpose, there are definitely some further improvements that I would like to make to it.</p>
<p>Firstly, loading all of the posts up front is not a great idea! For a start, when loading all the posts, I don&#39;t need the actual post content, as this isn&#39;t displayed, so I need to investigate if it is possible in Firebase to retrieve a subset of fields for a particular record.</p>
<p>Secondly, the markdown directive I have created for this purpose is quite specific and is tied to a model property. I would ideally like to make this more generic, and probably extract it out into its own (very small!) module entirely.</p>
<p>I would also like to extract the module entirely, and create my own <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> component, as my plan is to use the same functionality that the module provides as part of the improvements I have in mind for my blog-post-author project.</p>
